Multithreading and Concurrency in Java
Welcome to this repository dedicated to exploring and practicing Multithreading and Concurrency concepts in Java!

This repository serves as my personal playground and learning space for diving deep into how Java handles concurrent execution, managing shared resources, and optimizing performance through parallel programming.

About This Repository
The goal of this repository is to systematically understand and implement various multithreading and concurrency paradigms in Java. Each example or project aims to demonstrate a specific concept, problem, or solution related to concurrent programming. This includes:

Understanding Core Concepts: Threads, processes, concurrency vs. parallelism.
Synchronization Mechanisms: synchronized keyword, wait(), notify(), notifyAll().
Concurrency Utilities: java.util.concurrent package (Executors, Thread Pools, Futures, Callables, Locks, Semaphores, Latches, Barriers, etc.).
Common Concurrency Problems: Deadlock, Race Conditions, Livelock, Starvation.
Best Practices: Immutable objects, thread-safe data structures, volatile keyword.
Performance Considerations: Optimizing concurrent code.
Concepts Covered
Here's a non-exhaustive list of topics you can expect to find examples for in this repository:

Thread Creation and Lifecycle:
Extending Thread class
Implementing Runnable interface
Thread states
Synchronization:
synchronized methods and blocks
Object-level vs. Class-level locks
wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
Volatile Keyword:
Visibility issues and solutions
Atomic Operations:
java.util.concurrent.atomic package (e.g., AtomicInteger, AtomicLong)
Concurrency Utilities (java.util.concurrent package):
Executors and Thread Pools:
Executor, ExecutorService, Executors factory methods
ThreadPoolExecutor
Callables and Futures:
Asynchronous computations and results
Locks:
ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock
Semaphores:
Controlling access to shared resources
CountDownLatch:
Waiting for multiple threads to complete
CyclicBarrier:
Synchronizing multiple threads at a common barrier point
Exchanger:
Exchanging data between two threads
Concurrent Collections:
ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, BlockingQueue implementations
Concurrency Problems and Solutions:
Race Conditions
Deadlock detection and prevention
Livelock
Starvation
Project Structure
The repository will be organized logically, with each concept or example typically residing in its own package or directory.
